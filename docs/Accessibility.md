# Accessibility

For this lab, we need to make the to-do app
accessible. This includes satisfying these requirements:

1. Add aria-labels to each interactive component
2. Ensure the problem tags are used for different portions of the all
3. Make sure that screen readers can read the application
4. Ensure that users with low vision can view the app

In addition to these accessibility requirements,
we need to record a video which showcases two things:
1. The application being used entirely from the keyboard
2. The application running using a screen-reader
